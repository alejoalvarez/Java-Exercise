# Example check if array contains duplicated value
---

## Example 1 - Java 8

The Java 8 streamâ€™s distinct() method will extract all the unique values, and the count() will count the total size. And we can compare the size to find out if there is a duplicated value in an array.

## Example 2 - TreeSet

This example is similar to the above stream distinct solution. The TreeSet will automatically remove the duplicated values, and we can compare the size to find out if there is a duplicated value in an array.

## Example 3 - Loops

This example is a classic two for loops to determine if there is a duplicated value in an array.

## Example 4 - Set

Loops the array; if the Set contains the value, return true for duplication. Otherwise, add the value to the Set.
